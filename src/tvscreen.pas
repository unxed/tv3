{ TvScreen: the screen as the views see it: its size, the cell buffer of the
  whole screen, the shadow settings and the hooks a backend plugs in.

  Translated from magiblot/tvision @ b4831e2 (the screen-related parts, turned into
  variables and hooks):
    TScreen (screenWidth, screenHeight, screenBuffer, cursorLines),
    THardwareInfo::screenWrite / setCaretPosition / setCaretSize,
    shadowSize and shadowAttr (source/tvision/tview.cpp).
  The platform code behind these (terminal, DOS video memory, a window) is the
  backend (tv/DESIGN.md); the memory backend of the tests just leaves the cells
  in ScreenBuffer. Borland disclaimer and MIT notice: COPYRIGHT.magiblot.

  Views write cells into ScreenBuffer themselves (the top group's buffer is the
  screen buffer) and then call ScreenWrite for the changed run so that the
  backend can flush it. }
